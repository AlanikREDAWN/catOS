# catOS

This is my version of the personal OS website jam, found here: https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS

I decided to make it cat themed becuasue I love cats, and I thought it would be fun! The extra app that I added is a gallery app of a bunch of different artworks I've created. I plan on expanding it in the future, particularly the Meow Notes app
